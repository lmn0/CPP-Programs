plasma is an ionized gas produced at extremely high temperatures, as in the sun and other stars. it contains positive and negative charges in almost equal numbers. it is a good electrical conductor. that is why it can disrupt electrical power supply. 
in thermonuclear reactions the plasma produced is confined through use of magnetic fields. 
some comets have been observed to develop as many as nine tails. comets have very low density.although they are larger than any other body in solar system.*
